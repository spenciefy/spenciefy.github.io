      <p>
        Hey there - I'm currently a student at Columbia University studying
        computer science and sociology. I grew up in the Bay Area, and as a
        result was (for better or worse) exposed to the tech scene early on. I'd
        always thought it was super cool to come up with an idea and just make
        it. During high school I made a bunch of iOS apps, got lucky and worked
        at a couple cool companies, and generally drank the Silicon Valley
        Koolaid‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. Now I'm just trying to learn more about the world, work on
        projects that solve real problems, and do fun things with genuine
        people.
